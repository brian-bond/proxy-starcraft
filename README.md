# Proxy Starcraft

The ancient and noble pursuit of Proxy Starcraft is a game for people who
should *really* be doing something better with their time and abilities, but
aren't. It's a meta-game, where you design and build something that plays a
game for you, and then your game-playing constructs play against each other,
and the winner is the person whose simulacrum wins the game.

This repository contains shared code to make it easier to construct your
Starcraft-2-playing bot. Actual (non-toy) implementations should be committed
to other repositories, and it is considered unsporting to look at your
opponents' implementations.
